## **Introduction to HTML & Web Basics**

### HTML:
* HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
* It is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.
* HTML defines the structure and content of a web page.

### **How browsers render it:**

1. The browser reads the HTML file line by line.
2. It builds the **DOM (Document Object Model)** â€” a tree-like structure of the page.
3. The browser then displays the structured content visually based on HTML + CSS.

###  Structure of an HTML Document
* `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
* `<html>` element is the root element of an HTML page
* `<head>` element contains meta information about the HTML page
* `<title>` element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
* `<body>` element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
* `<h1>` element defines a large heading
* `<p>` element defines a paragraph
