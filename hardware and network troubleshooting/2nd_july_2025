## Day 6:
### Safe mode:
Safe Mode is a diagnostic mode in Windows that starts the computer with a minimal set of drivers and services, which makes it easier to find and remove harmful malware and viruses without activating them.

**Types of safe mode:** <br>
1. Safe Mode:<br>
   Used to diagnose and fix basic system issues.
   
2. Safe Mode with Networking: <br>
   Includes network drivers and services. Allowing access to the internet or network drives for troubleshooting.
   
4. Safe Mode with Command Prompt:<br>
   Loads a minimal environment with Command Prompt instead of the normal desktop interface
   
### Recovery tools:
- The Recovery Drive utility in Windows is a tool designed to back up essential system files needed to restore a PC to its original state.
- It fixes problems that prevent Windows from booting.
- Rolls back system files and settings to an earlier point in time without affecting personal files.

### OS repair:
It is used when the OS fails to boot or behaves abnormally.<br>
Use repair commands:
- sfc /scannow – Scans and restores system files.
- DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth – Repairs corrupted Windows images.
- Bootable USB for repair and system reinstall.

### Virus/Malware Symptoms:
- Slow performance
- Frequent crashes or freezes
- Slow startup
- Unexplained files or folders disappearing
- Unusual network activity:
  -  Malware can send or receive data, causing increased network activity, especially when your device is idle.
- Increased data usage:
  - Malware can consume more data than usual, especially if it's sending or receiving large amounts of information. 
- Browser-Related Symptoms:
  - Unwanted pop-up ads
  - Browser redirects
  
### Basic removal:
1.	Enter safe mode.
2.	Run Antivirus scan
3.	Delete suspicious Programs via Control Panel.
4.	Clear Temp files.
5.	Reset Web browser setting.
6.	Check startup Programs
7.	Update OS and antivirus.
   
### Where to Keep Windows Backups?
Backups are essential for recovery in case of OS failure or data loss.
- External Drive:
  Recommended option for offline, safe backup storage.
- Separate Internal Drive (e.g., D:, E:):
  Better than storing on the system drive (C:), but vulnerable if the whole disk fails.
- Cloud Storage:
  Services like Google Drive, OneDrive, or Dropbox allow automatic syncing and access from anywhere.

### Modern Internet Transmission (Wired Connections):
**RJ45**:
- RJ45 stands for Registered Jack 45.
- It is a standard connector used for Ethernet networking cables.
- RJ45 connectors are typically used to connect computers, routers, switches, and other networking devices.
- It has 8 pins (8P8C – 8 position, 8 contact) and connects twisted-pair cables like Cat5e, Cat6, Cat6a.
- Commonly used for LAN (Local Area Network) connections.

*Cat5, Cat6, Cat6e: Categories of twisted-pair cables used in wired networks, offering various speeds and shielding levels.*

## How to Make a RJ‐45 Cable:
1. Strip the cable to remove 1 inch of the outer sheath.
2. Untwist and straighten the wires inside of the cable
3. Arrange the wires into the right order.

| **Pin Number** | **Wire Color (T568B)**   | **Signal**       |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------- |
| 1              | White Orange             | Transmit + (TX+) |
| 2              | Orange                   | Transmit – (TX–) |
| 3              | White Green              | Receive + (RX+)  |
| 4              | Blue                     | Unused / PoE +   |
| 5              | White Blue               | Unused / PoE +   |
| 6              | Green                    | Receive – (RX–)  |
| 7              | White Brown              | Unused / PoE –   |
| 8              | Brown                    | Unused / PoE –   |

4. Trim the wires into an even line 1⁄2 inch (13 mm) from sheathing
5. Insert the wires into the RJ-45 connector.
6. Stick the connector into the crimping part of the tool and squeeze twice.
7. Remove the cable from the tool and check that all of the pins are down & test the cable.
