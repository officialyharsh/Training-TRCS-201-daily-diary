## PC Hardware Trouble shooting:
### Components of a CPU:
### 1. Motherboard:
A motherboard is the main circuit board in a computer system. It connects all of the internal components, like the memory, processor, graphics card and other hardware. Its also known as PCB (Printed circuit board).

*Some components of Motherboard:*  <br>
- **Processor Socket:** <br>
   It is mechanical and electrical interface on a motherboard that securely connects a central processing unit (CPU) to the rest of the computer system.
  
- **CMOS backup battery:** <br>
   It is a small, coin-shaped battery that helps to keep the date and time accurate on computer. It ensures these settings are retained even when the computer is turned off and disconnected from a power source.
  
- **LAN (Local area network):**<br>
   It is the built-in Ethernet port that allows the computer to connect to a wired local area network for internet and data communication.
  
- **RAM Slots:** <br>
   Slots for installing RAM (Random Access Memory) modules.
  
- **Chipset**<br>
   Communication between Northbridge (handles CPU, RAM, GPU communication) and Southbridge (handles I/O, storage devices).
  
- **Expansion Slots:** <br>
  - Expansion slots on a motherboard are sockets designed to accommodate expansion cards, which add or enhance a computer's functionality
  - Common types: PCI.
    
- **Power Connectors** <br>
   Connects to the power supply unit (PSU).
  
- **Storage Connectors:** <br>
   SATA ports for connecting hard drives (HDD), solid-state drives (SSD), and optical drives.
  
- **BIOS Chip:** <br>
   Firmware that initializes hardware during startup and provides runtime services for the OS.
  
- **Input/Output (I/O) Ports:** <br>
  - Located on the back of the motherboard.
  - Includes USB ports, audio jacks, Ethernet, HDMI, DisplayPort, PS/2, etc.
    
- **Heat Sinks:** <br>
 Passive cooling components for chipsets and VRMs.

### 2. **Fan:**

* Used for cooling the motherboard.
* Prevents overheatingt.

### 3. **Power Supply with Fan**

* Provides **electrical power** to all parts of the computer.
* Has a **built-in fan** to cool itself & CPU cabinet during operation.
* Converts electricity from the wall (AC) to usable computer power (DC).

### 4. **Connectors**

* Cables and plugs that connect components to the power supply and motherboard.

### 5. **Expansion Slots**
* Used to insert extra cards like:<br>
  * **Graphics cards**
  * **Sound cards**
  * **Wi-Fi/network cards**


### 6. **Hard Disk Drive (HDD):**
* Stores data, software, and the operating system.
* Located **under the optical drive** in the cabinet.

### 7. **Optical Drive (CD/DVD Drive):**

* Used to read/write **CDs and DVDs**

*How to locate components of a CPU?*

- Look for the power supply with fan (usually at the back top or bottom of the cabinet).
- In front of it is the optical drive.
- On it's side is the Motherboard.
- Below the optical drive is the hard disk drive.

### Difference between RAM and Cache memory:

| Feature        | **RAM (Random Access Memory)**            | **Cache Memory**                          |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**    | It holds programs and data that are currently executed by the CPU. | It holds frequently used data by the CPU.  |
| **Speed**      | Slower than cache                         | Much faster than RAM                      |
| **Size**       | Larger (in GBs, e.g., 8GB, 16GB)          | Smaller than RAM  |

**Why do we need Cache memory?**
- It helps the **CPU work faster and more efficiently** by reducing the time it takes to access data.
  * Cache memory is **much faster** than RAM.
  * It stores **frequently used instructions and data**, so the CPU doesnâ€™t have to wait for slower RAM.
  * Without cache, the Processor would **waste cycles**.<br>
So it is used to remove mismatch between RAM and Processor speed.

### Difference between RAM and Hard Disk:

| Feature              | RAM (Random Access Memory)           | Hard Disk                            |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**          | Temporary memory for currently running programs | Permanent storage for files, software, and OS  |
| **Storage Type**   | Temporary (loses data when off)                   | Permanent (keeps data when off)|
| **Speed**            | Much faster                                     | Slower compared to RAM                         |
| **Storage Capacity** | Smaller                   | Larger                  |
| **Access Method**    | Direct access by CPU                            | Slower access through file system              |
| **Cost**      |  Expensive                                  | Cheaper                                        |
| **Function**         | Helps run active programs and processes         | Stores data, files, OS, and installed programs |

**Process of Booting:**
| **Step**                                        | **Description**                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Power On**                                 | You press the **power button**. Electricity flows to all components.                                                          |
| **2. Signal to RAM (Firmware loads Bootstrap)** | The **BIOS/UEFI firmware** stored in ROM sends a signal to RAM and loads Bootstrap Loader. |
| **3. Hard Disk Copy Transferred to RAM**        | The Bootstrap Loader finds the operating system (OS) on the hard disk and copies essential OS files into RAM.     |
| **4. OS Starts (OS gets control)**              | Once the OS is loaded into RAM, it takes over the system. The desktop/interface appears, and the system is ready for use.     |
