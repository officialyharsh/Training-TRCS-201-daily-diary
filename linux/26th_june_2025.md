## Introduction to Linux Shell and basic commands:
### Kernel:
- The kernel is a computer program that is the core of a computerâ€™s operating system, with complete control over everything in the system.
- Think of it as as Chef working in a hotel. You as a coustmer can't see the chef working but get your order (output).

### Shell:
- Shell is a special user program that provides an interface for the user to use operating system services.
- Using the same scenario, think of shell as a waiter, who takes your order (input) and gives it to the chef (Kernel).

Shell is divided into two categories-
1. Command Line Shell:

2. Graphical shell:

**Types of shell:**
- BASH (Bourne Again SHell)
- CSH (C SHell)
- KSH (Korn SHell)

 ### File system structure:

| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/`       | The slash / character denotes the root of the filesystem tree. exp: Trunk of a tree.|
| `/home`   | Contains personal directories of user. |
| `/lib`    | Contains system libraries and critical file.|

## Issues faced:
Running `whatis command` always returns "nothing appropriate"

**Solution found:**

`whatis` uses an index created and maintained by `mandb` to locate the documentation you're looking for. If said index doesn't exist, or if the command you're looking for isn't in the existing index, you'll see Nothing appropriate. If your setup doesn't have a `mandb` index yet, you can create one by running `sudo mandb`
